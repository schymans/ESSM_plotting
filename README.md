## General purpose
This repository contains python scripts to plot symbolic expressions generated using the Python package [ESSM](https://essm.readthedocs.io). 

To use the functions in the file `plotting.py` within a Jupyter notebook, clone this repo as a sub-repo into the one where your jupyter notbook resides, then provide the relative path to the repo (e.g. `../ESSM_plotting/` and import the desired function
```
import imp
path_plotting = '../ESSM_plotting/`

# Importing plotting function
mod = imp.load_source('plotting', path_plotting)
plot_expr2 = getattr(mod, 'plot_expr2')
```

If you would like to import the functions e.g. into a project residing in [renkulab.io](https://renkulab.io/), execute in the parent folder of your renkulab project:
```
renku --no-external-storage dataset add --create ESSM_plotting \
git@github.com:schymans/ESSM_plotting.git
```
This will save the contents in `data/ESSM_plotting`. 

If you would like to have it e.g. just in the base folder, simply move it using renku:
```
renku mv data/ESSM_plotting/ ESSM_plotting/
```
